# SupplyMission
You are a sergeant on a military peacekeeping mission. Your task is to drop a package in a designated red drop zone. The package contains mission-critical items and is very important to be delivered at the exact location for the success of the mission.  Everyone before you has failed to finish the task. The success of the mission now depends on you.
